# Curry sauce
## Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon of ginger, minced
* 2 tablespoons of curry powder (adjust to taste)
* 1 teaspoon of ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon of ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon of paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (adjust to taste, optional for heat)
* 1 can (14 oz) of diced tomatoes
* 1 cup of vegetable broth or chicken broth
* 1 cup of coconut milk
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Optional: 1 tablespoon of tomato paste for added richness

## Instructions
* Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat.
* Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
* Stir in the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another minute until fragrant.
* Add the curry powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using). Stir well to coat the onions with the spices, and cook for another minute.
* Pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and vegetable broth. If using tomato paste, add it now. Stir to combine.
* Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer gently for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
* After 10 minutes, stir in the coconut milk and season with salt and pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to simmer for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
* Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if necessary, adding more salt, pepper, or spices as desired.
* If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can blend it with an immersion blender or transfer it to a blender and blend until smooth.
* Serve the curry sauce hot over rice, vegetables, meat, or whatever you like!
